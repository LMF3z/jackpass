# JackPass My Password Manager in Go

Looking for a way to improve my Go (Golang) skills and learn something new, I developed my own password manager (similar to KeyPass).

## What I learned

- How to use Cobra CLI
- Encryption with web standards
- App packaging
- Adding content to the clipboard and clearing it for security

## Try the project

You can download the code, generate your password database, and if you manage to break the encryption, let me know so I can improve it. (Use a secure master password with 12 or more combined characters).

## Build and Install

Run

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Add CLI to path: Agg next line to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/jackpass"
```
